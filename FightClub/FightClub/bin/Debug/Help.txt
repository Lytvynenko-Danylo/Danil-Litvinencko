The game involves two players. The role of the second player is played by the computer.
The game is based on rounds.
In one round, one player attacks, the other defends. The attacking player chooses to strike a piece
body of the opponent (head, body, legs). The defending player selects the body part for the block (head,
body, legs). At the end of the round, the result is calculated.
- If the choice of a part of the body by the attacking and defending player coincides, the kick is considered
locked and health glasses are not removed.
- If the choice of a part of the body by the attacking and defending player does not match the kick is considered
inflicted damage to a defending player.
After striking, the number of health points of the defending player is checked.
- If the health points of a defending player are less than or equal to zero, it is considered dead and
the attacking player wins.
- If the health points of the defending player are greater than zero, the round is considered to be over and
players change places (the attacker becomes defensive)
